# Spotify Scanner

The following project consists of a Custom Spotify Web API Wrapper that enables easy to use, programmatic access to spotify Web API endpoints with authentication, as well as an example implementation of a Top Songs Analyzer that grabs the logged in spotify user's top 'n' tracks along with its 'audio features' and album artwork. 

## spotify.js
